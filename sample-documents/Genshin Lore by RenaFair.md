**TRAVELER’S TWIN** [(return to top)](#id.d99ut0di65pp)

- Was the first to wake up upon arriving in Teyvat, woke the Traveler when they saw the Cataclysm

- Despite arriving from the stars, the twin is listed within Irminsul as a Teyvat local and not a Descender

  - Their first appearance was in Khaenri’ah before traveling the world after the Cataclysm

    - It’s said that the twin only arrived because the Heavens responded to the summoning. No further details given 

    - They lived with The Jester who was Khaenri’ah’s Royal Mage for a while

  - The end of their journey was blurred within the Irminsul by an unknown entity

- Traveled with Dainsleif in search for their fate, but parted halfway for reasons unknown and now views Dainsleif as an enemy

  - The twin helped Chlothar Alberich to bring back Caribert’s mind at one point, and learned about Loom of Fate which they never told Dainsleif

- Arrived at a place called ‘The Sea of Flowers at the End’ after they completed their journey

  - This is the reason why the twin can’t continue their journey between worlds with the Traveler, because the Traveler once mentioned wanting to find a place in the universe where the one flower is in full bloom

- The twin is regarded as Prince/Princess by the Abyss Order, something that’s not their usual norm according to Venti

  - The title was given by the founder of the Order; Chlothar Alberich

- Currently, the twin doesn’t know how to utilize the Loom of Fate to its full potential, but believes there is still time before the Heavenly Principal awakens

  - Caribert died at the age of 8 during its construction, but a remnant of his consciousness remained to mature, allowing him to implant false memories for the people of Vimara Village. He also implanted a false memory within Dainsleif, making him believe that he had given the eye of the first Field Tiller to the Traveler

  - The Loom of Fate is able to weave Ley Lines of its own at its full potential, and will lose its abilities to implant memories when that time comes

**HEXENZIRKEL** [(return to top)](#id.d99ut0di65pp)

  - Bosacius who had lost his sanity joined in on the fray and helped seal the Chasm bed before being trapped there together with Boyang, Yelan’s ancestor

  - Many of the Milleliths died protecting the area

- Inazuma was engulfed in a pitch-black fog and monsters ravaged the land. Countless lives were lost and the nation barely escaped being obliterated

- Sumeru was nearly drowned in a dark flood that swallowed fields, villages, and cities in what the Sages call The Black Tide

  - According to the Aranara, the earth witnessed the descent of the sun, evaporating all water and leaving a red world behind

**FATUI** [(return to top)](#id.d99ut0di65pp)

- An organization from Snezhnaya that had spread across all seven nations, known for their rather forceful diplomacy and technological advancement

  - This causes them to be despised by the public wherever they go

  - Dottore exchanged knowledge with Nahida for the Electro and Dendro Gnoses

  - Arlecchino received the Hydro Gnosis from Neuvillette in a diplomatic exchange

- According to Childe, each Harbinger has their own goal, and that joining the Fatui is simply a means to an end

  - This is further confirmed by Mavuika and Capitano who agreed that the Harbingers are only united in their search for the Gnoses, but each have their own agenda

- After Scaramouche removed himself from Irminsul, Mikhail exclaimed how the Sixth seat has been empty for hundreds of years years in the new reality

**THE HARBINGERS** [(return to top)](#id.d99ut0di65pp)

- Despite being a Khaenri’ahn survivor and disliking the Gods, Pierro sided with the Tsaritsa for an unknown reason

  - It was said by Scaramouche that he used to be Khaenri’ah’s Eclipse Dynasty Royal Mage, but not much is known about him

  - He seems to want something from Scaramouche, as he sends him to the Abyss constantly

  - His plan is to uphold the virtue of the folly, and to ensure that the Tsaritsa will once again be a God who loves all humans and to have all their wishes be granted

- Il Dottore was called back by the Tsaritsa after his dealings in Sumeru, he managed to exchange both the Electro and Dendro Gnosis for knowledge with Nahida

  - He was found by Katsuragi within Shakkei Pavilion, and was taught how to live like a human while living in Tatarasuna. He learned smithing from Niwa, an Isshin Art master

    - He believed he was betrayed a second time when Niwa disappeared after the Mikage Furnace failed, not knowing he was killed by Dottore

  - He then met a sickly child after leaving Tatarasuna, only for the child to die after one night. He saw this as the final betrayal

  - He joined the Fatui after being persuaded by Pierro, and Dottore released the power that Ei had sealed within him, making him stronger than his original construct

  - After exchanging the Traveler’s life with Ei’s Gnosis from Yae Miko, he went off-radar before arriving in Sumeru and ascended as Shouki no Kami

  - He spent some time within the Sanctuary of Surasthana after being defeated and the Electro Gnosis ripped out of him before being sent by Nahida to retrieve information from Irminsul with the Traveler

  - The truth about Niwa and the Tatarasuna incident came to light, and he wiped himself from history much like Rukkhadevata did

  - The Traveler later found him as a completely innocent puppet, he implored to see through the hidden records Nahida managed to save in time and accepted his past transgressions

- After completing his mission in Liyue, he traveled around before being trialed in Fontaine and ended up fighting the All-Devouring Narwhal in the Primordial Sea. He’s returned to Snezhnaya by Pierro’s order for Project Stuzha

  - His real name is Ajax, and he was originally a quiet, meek child until he fell into the Abyss at age 14

  - He was trained by an Abyssal swordswoman named Skirk for 3 months. When he re-emerged, only 3 days had passed on Teyvat

    - He became bloodthirsty after that, and his father enlisted him into the Fatui hoping to tame him, only to see him take down a group of full grown men

  - Pulcinella recruited him as a pretense to mete out punishment, but made him the youngest Harbinger

  - He dislikes covert operations, in extend to that, he dislikes a majority of the Harbingers

  - When he was in Fontaine, he lost control over his Vision due to the Narwhal’s influence and was sent to the Fortress of Meropide after his trial before fighting said Narwhal

  - Returned to Fontaine temporarily to find Skirk, but eventually had to return to Snezhnaya

- Unknown where Pantalone is presently situated, but he had fully rented out the Goth Grand Hotel for time indeterminate and paid in full

  - He is the owner of the Northland Bank obsessed with fair exchange to the point of wanting to overthrow the imbalance between Gods and humans

  - He works closely with Dottore

  - The Fortress of Meropide’s Credit Coupons was his idea

- Arlecchino is the head of the House of the Hearth, an intelligence-gathering orphanage based in Fontaine. She has the mysterious power of Khaenri’ah’s Balemoon bloodline that she herself isn’t too knowledgeable about. Currently she’s returned to Snezhnaya

  - She became the head after killing the previous head, Harbinger Crucabena, and was pardoned of her crimes by the Tsaritsa

  - Prior to the flooding, she nearly assassinated Furina to obtain her Gnosis, but realized that Furina doesn’t have it and seemed to be under a curse

  - The Hydro Gnosis was given by Neuvillette as a diplomatic exchange for her contributions in helping Poisson

  - If any of the orphans wanted to leave, they first have to fight her to earn their freedom before ingesting flames extracted by her to wipe their memories of the House. She made an agreement with Neuvillette that these children were not to be trialed for their past once they’ve left

  - One of the orphans faked her death and took the place of Shuumatsuban Gendo Ringo at the Grand Narukami Shrine _(a/n: there’s a whole secret quest for this)_

  - Scaramouche says she’s a wolf in a sheep’s clothing, putting a cordial front to exert control over people

- A survivor from Khaenri’ah, Il Capitano had a run-in with Grandmaster Varka, but neither were hostile with one another. He’s currently helping Natlan repel the Abyss and siding with Mavuika

  - According to Scaramouche, he possesses absolute righteousness that gets annoying after a while

  - He’s doing phlogiston research involving Natlan’s Saurians

    - No clue what it’s about, only that he’s curious about their special constitution with phlogiston

    - He brought Ororon with him to the research center, unknown for what reason

  - His reason for helping Natlan is because he was shown kindness by the chief of the Flower-Feather Clan, Ayizu, after escaping the Cataclysm

    - Ayizu told him the secret of the Gnosis just before his death

  - He wears a mask due to the rotting of his flesh even with the curse on him

  - He only knew Dainsleif by name, and saw him travel with the Traveler’s sibling at one point

    - He doesn’t know how Dainsleif slows his body’s deterioration

  - He found out about the Source Mechanism thanks to three scholars - Aberewaa, Bosomtwe, and Cuxtal

    - Mavuika has never heard of them

  - He secretly meets up with the Lord of the Night to ask her help ‘for the sake of those countless lost souls and Natlan’s future’

    - He also has a final foe to face, unknown who

- Not much is known about Pulcinella, aside from the fact that he keeps watch over Childe’s family and does a number of things for their benefit

  - Scaramouche says that the underlying meaning for his action is that Childe’s entire family is in his hands, and that Childe is unbearably naive

  - Many went to Tenshukaku to seek help including Nozomu, but never returned as it was the year the Shogun puppet took full control over Inazuma

  - Kabukimono went as well bringing the feather Ei had left him, but didn’t hear Yae’s promise for assistance and returned empty-handed

  - Niwa, who had suspected Escher from the start, was killed and his heart used to create a device to cleanse the furnace

  - Nagamasa, who was third-in-command, had to kill Katsuragi when Katsuragi insisted he took the blame for the furnace’s malfunction before leaving

  - Kabukimono went to the furnace and shut it down himself using the device, only to be told by Escher that the heart within it was ripped out by Niwa’s hands. Kabukimono then left Tatarasuna in betrayal _(read:_ [_THE HARBINGERS_](#id.uygjxaqj4xd4) _for more Scaramouche)_

- After Scaramouche removed his existence, the reality turned out that a descendant of one of the Gokaden waged war against the smithing schools

  - It was Niwa and another bladesmith who jumped into the furnace, sacrificing themselves for the people

- During the war regarding the Vision Hunt decree, some Orobashi fanatics destroyed the wards to release the Tatarigami once more with the help of Nathan, a Fatui spy

  - This led to diseases and hallucinations being spread all over the island and contaminating the flora

  - For unknown reason, the Yashiori Guardians’ Kitain clan’s bloodline ended, so no one was there to subdue the Tatarigami

  - Thunder and rain persisted on Yashiori until the Traveler restored the wards and cleared the weather. Nathan disappeared shortly after

  - Yasumoto overdosed on his experimental naku weed concoction after theTraveler helped him

- The people of Higi Village soon either fell sick and died by the hands of the Tatarigami, or fled through ‘Uncle’ Onitaka the pirate. Washizu ended up succumbing to the hallucinations and sacrificed the remaining villagers. The Traveler ended up having to kill him

  - Ruu thought he had done what’s best for the tribe

  - Kapatcir placed a time loop curse on the island, repeating the island’s final four days before its destruction until she hears his song again

  - The Traveler ceased the time loop and lifted the island’s fog after bringing Ruu’s spirit to Seirai where Kapatcir was slain so he can sing to her one last time

- Kapatcir’s resentment for what the tribe did to Ruu coalesced into the Thunder Manifestation residing at the peak of Seirai Island

  - She then met a cat named Neko who stayed by her side since

- After Kanna Kapatcir was killed by the Raiden Shogun, a ward was erected to contain her resentment over Ruu’s death

- Years after the Cataclysm, Hibiki undid the seals of the ward to assist Ako Doumeki in fleeing the shogunate as Doumeki reminded her of Takamine the Mittsplitter who she had to kill

  - He eventually died protecting the forest during the Cataclysm, and his job fell to the Aranara

- The Wall of Samiel was constructed by Rukkhadevata at the border to protect the forest from desertification

- Rukkhadevata created her familiars, plant-like little creatures called Aranara born from the pomegranates of the Ashvattha Tree grown from the spirit realm Sarva

  - The first to be born was Arumuhukunda, followed by many others. The Aranara lived in Old Vanarana where they befriend many humans

  - When the Cataclysm hit, Old Vanarana was destroyed, and the Aranara moved their home within a dream anchored by the Tree of Dreams

  - The Aranara befriended Nara Varuna who helped them repair the Varuna Contraption, it’s strongly implied that Nara Varuna is Traveler’s twin

  - Death is not a concept to the Aranara, as they believe past and future will meet in Sarva

  - Presently, only children are able to see and interact with the Aranara

- Rukkhadevata also made an oath to the elemental lifeforms born from Apep the Dendro dragon

  - When the forbidden knowledge has been cleansed, the lifeforms will return to their world within Apep

- With the help of her followers who established the Amurta (Biology) Darshan of Sumeru Akademiya, Rukkhadevata managed to create a flourishing rainforest, and Sumeru City was built atop the Divine Tree

  - The Sages assisted Rukkhadevata in managing the nation’s affairs, and created the Akasha System powered by her Gnosis

  - Five other Darshans eventually came to existence; Rtawahist (Illuminationism), Spantamad (Elementalism), Haravatat (Semiotics), Vahumana (Aetiology), and Kshahrewar (Technology)

  - A department of the Temple of Silence was established after Hermanubis’s followers left the desert for the custody and disposal of information and document not fit for the public, but due to the Sages’ growing corruption 400 years ago, the followers left and returned to the desert. The Akademiya retained the department as a dummy to uphold their reputation

- When the Cataclysm hit, The Withering spread uncontrollably throughout Sumeru, causing decay and destruction so bad that it was called ‘The Black Tide’

  - Rukkhadevata descended to the heart of the land, where the Abyssal creatures made their dwelling, with some of her followers to put an end to the devastation

  - It was said by the Aranara that Nara Varuna joined in on the fight, but unknown if Varuna and Rukkhadevata know each other

  - The area was then turned into ‘a cavern of the damned where neither sun, moon, nor fire shine’

  - Rukkhadevata never returned from her journey, but she did pluck the purest branch from Irminsul to create Nahida as her successor before her death

- The Sages eventually found a new Dendro Archon within some scorched ruins and brought her back to Sumeru, hoping she would have the same divine wisdom as Rukkhadevata

  - They received a rude realization when Kusanali seems to know no more than a human child, and locked her in the Sanctuary of Surasthana since

- Over time, the people of Sumeru believes Lesser Lord Kusanali as an Archon merely in name, and continued worshiping Greater Lord Rukkhadevata

  - Some believed that Lesser Lord Kusanali doesn’t exist

- After Rukkhadevata’s death, new breakthrough in the Akademiya has been far and few in between, and the Sages are somehow getting desperate, particularly in treating Irminsul

  - Researchers would often meditate in Avidya Forest to connect with Irminsul to reach Paripurna Life

  - Some researchers would go their whole lives without connecting with Irminsul, some would go mad after coming in contact with the contaminated divine consciousness

  - Mad scholars are then sent to Aaru Village, where Kusanali secretly calms them from their hysterics through the still-active Akasha System

- Every so often, there is a Jnagarbha Day where the Akademiya enters new information into the Akasha through Knowledge Capsules

- Dar al-Shifa, a hospital for treating and researching Eleazar, was constructed outside of Aaru Village before it was abandoned _(read:_ [_DESERT OF HADRAMAVETH_](#id.slf3hzwnl6o3) _for more info on Eleazar)_

  - At one point, Dottore became a doctor there and experimented on the patients, many died by his hands

  - The Akademiya used the abandoned hospital to extract Divine Canned Knowledge from the mad scholars of Aaru Village in the middle of the night

- The people of Sumeru doesn’t dream, as according to the Sages, it is a blessing from Rukkhadevata due to their wisdom

  - Rukkhadevata took the people’s dreams to serve as her wisdom when going against the forbidden knowledge after King Deshret unleashed it

  - The Sages then harvested their dreams via the Akasha System using the Sabzeruz Festival samsara to power the false God

  - Dunyarzad almost died from the harvesting due to her Eleazar, but was saved by Kusanali

- Marana’s Avatar, that is The Withering, slowly regained its power and is threatening Vanarana and Sumeru once more

  - Traveler and Arama went on a journey to the Land of Grounded Dreams beneath Sumeru to defeat the Avatar

  - Arama found out that the original Ashvattha Tree has been corrupted by Marana and absorbed all its powers and memories

  - Arama became the new Ashvattha Tree after helping the Traveler take down the Avatar

- The Withering also came from elemental beings born from Apep at the end of their lifespan _(a/n: read_ [_TEYVAT_](#id.bk0s32a5bq4z) _for more)_

- A Divine Knowledge Capsule from the desert was brought to Port Ormos, the Eremites believed it to be King Deshret’s power and means of his resurrection

  - The leader of Ayn al-Ahmar immediately lose his sanity after activating the capsule, and Alhaitham pocketed it away before the Matra could grab it

  - Alhaitham was baited with the capsule’s content by the Akademiya, but he saw through their plot and turned from them

- The Sages worked together with Il Dottore using the Electro Gnosis to create a new God out of Scaramouche to have full control over the nation’s wisdom

  - The Traveler managed to connect with Scaramouche’s divine consciousness due to him in the process of being born as a God via Haypasia

  - This plan was born from their disappointment in Kusanali

  - Massive amount of Divine Canned Knowledge is supposed to be used to ascend him to divinity, but the Sages were captured before they could implement them

  - The Electro Gnosis powers the entire robot

  - Cyno was locked out of the full details despite being General Mahamatra, and chose to exile himself in Aaru Village after he was dismissed by the Grand Sage

- Cyno, Alhaitham, Dehya, and the Traveler planned a coup to free Nahida and bring down the Sages after teaming up at Aaru Village

- The entirety of Sumeru undergo a massive change after the coup

  - Nahida shuts down the Akasha system permanently so the people can think for themselves once more

  - Four out of six of the Great Sages, including Grand Sage Azar, were banished to Avidya Forest forever. Cyno deems the sentence too light

  - Alhaitham temporarily takes over the Sages’ works until they’re replaced

  - Cyno returns as General Mahamatra

- After Nahida cleansed the Irminsul tree, Teyvat has its vitality returned

  - Dreams return to the people of Sumeru

  - Eleazar is permanently eradicated

  - The Withering will no longer return, but those that have appeared will still need to be cleansed by the Forest Watchers

  - Nahida returned the elemental lifeforms to Apep despite having no memories of Rukkhadevata and the oath they had made

- Greater Lord Rukkhadevata’s existence is completely erased from everyone’s memories after Irminsul was cleansed and reality was altered

  - Everyone believed that Nahida is Rukkhadevata who lost all her power and wisdom after sacrificing them to save Sumeru in the Cataclysm, and the Sages locked her up for it

  - The Aranara no longer have memories over Queen Aranyani, as they refer to Nahida as Lord of the Woods

  - The people of Sumeru believes Rukkhadevata is the name of a massive tree, and the Sabzeruz Festival has always been the birthday celebration for Nahida

  - Contents for the book ‘Folio of Foliage’ is changed completely

  - The only one who remembers Rukkhadevata is the Traveler

- The Temple of Silence department in the Akademiya is re-established after Cyno successfully won the Ba fragment from Sethos

**GREAT RED SAND** [(return to top)](#id.d99ut0di65pp)

- There exists another, similarly massive ruin golem in the desert that was still active until the Traveler disabled its systems

- Many thousands of years ago, the Flower Goddess traversed Sumeru for 72 nights after being casted down by the war between Thrones

  - Her wounds creates springs that sprouted lilly flowers that birthed the Jinni

  - Padisarahs were born from her powers

- King Deshret (Amun) then befriended Rukkhadevata (Aranyani) and the Flower Goddess (Nabu Malikata), sharing his throne with them during the Archon War

  - Together, they established Ay-Khanoum, City of Amphitheater/Moon Maiden

  - Sabzeruz Festival became a birthday celebration from the Flower Goddess to Rukkhadevata

  - It's shown that King Deshret holds affections to the Flower Goddess, unknown if she reciprocate

- King Deshret was given the Gnosis, but rejected it as he wanted to pave his own path for his people

  - He's not above going against the Heavens despite warnings from the Flower Goddess

  - She saw that he may be able to break the shackles that was placed upon Teyvat

- Unable to persuade him, the Flower Goddess agreed to show King Deshret a higher knowledge, but warned that he'll lose many if he proceeds

  - The two had to perform a ritual to show the secrets of sky and Abyss 

  - Using his body as conduit and the oases as trade, King Deshret sought to see his desires manifest

  - The Flower Goddess ended up dying as a result, though she had planned for it

  - King Deshret emerged from the revelation alone, and mourned for her since

- Ay-Khanoum was eventually destroyed when a Celestial pillar descended after King Deshret saw the secrets, turning the area into a desert

  - Rukkhadevata ended up leaving King Deshret for the forest when he continued to be stuck mourning for the Flower Goddess

  - The Jinns who once served the Flower Goddess, served King Deshret after her death and allowed themselves to be bottled by him

- The Eternal Oasis was constructed as a cemetery for the Flower Goddess after King Deshret sought the Celestial pillar

  - A Jinni was tasked to keep the Oasis's springs flow, but went against King Deshret's words to guard the human cities instead

  - King Deshret told the Jinni that her body is put to rest there and that she’ll return someday, though this is just a lie the Jinni never realized

- Seven city-states were born after the destruction of Ay-Khanoum, such as Gurabad, Tulaytullah, and Saleh

  - Each has its own King

  - None of these cities lasted long

- King Deshret then tried to create a utopia free of ‘worry, schemes, and slavery’ based on what the Flower Goddess taught him. Under his rule, he established the Seven Pillars; seven animal-humanoid beings that serve him

  - Of the seven, only the supreme spirit and Dragon King Apep remain alone and not appearing in person, while the others faithfully served King Deshret

  - They are Goat-King Heryshaf, Minister of Ministers; Crocodile King Sobek, Captain of Captains; Ibis King Thoth, Scribe of Scribes; Hermanubis, greatest of Sages; Bennu Most-Radiant; and Shesepankh Most-Holy. The texts refer the last two more as human souls and Jinni

- He eventually fell into madness, and unleashed forbidden knowledge not of the world to his people, bringing Eleazar and The Withering into existence

  - Eleazar took many lives of his people, turning their skin into hardened black scales with no known cure

  - Rukkhadevata came to his rescue, and asked his priests to create temples for her to imbue them with life to mitigate the disaster

  - King Deshret’s survivors would congregate in Aaru Village, while the King sacrificed himself to quell the forbidden knowledge, though in truth he was devoured by Apep the Dendro dragon

- The people of Aaru Village are apathetic on which deity is in charge of Sumeru, be it the Dendro Archon or King Deshret

- In helping King Deshret purge the forbidden knowledge, Rukkhadevata used up all her strength to control the forbidden knowledge and regressed to the size of a child

  - This was witnessed by one of King Deshret’s priest, Kasala, before his death

  - The knowledge stems from the bottom of the Abyss, knowledge even she couldn’t understand

- After the death of King Deshret, Hermanubis gathered his followers and the Tighnarian priests before leading them to the city of Tulaytullah where they established the Temple of Silence

  - From that day, they became stewards of knowledge that survived from King Deshret’s civilization

  - Barely a century later, fights break out between the Eremites leader, and the King of Gurabad lay siege on Tulaytullah

  - The ruling elite colluded with their oppressors and betrayed the Temple to hold onto their rule over the city, declaring that the Temple’s knowledge is the cause for corruption

- To keep the forbidden knowledge brought forth by King Deshret at bay, Hermanubis exhausted his power, but split his being into many pieces to ensure the Temple of Silence’s survival. At present, Cyno is in possession of two of his pieces called the Ba fragments

  - This power allowed the Temple to fight against their oppressors, but the same power made people fear those who wield it, and they left to the rainforest where they work together with the Akademiya until 400 years ago when the Akademiya Sages became too corrupted

  - The people of the Temple of Silence returned to the desert and remained there until the present day where Cyno helped re-establish their connection with the Akademiya

- Over time, the Eremites believed that Rukkhadevata stripped King Deshret of his title as God of Wisdom and betraying him, this causes a rift between the desert and rainforest

  - This was actually constructed by the Akademiya Sages

- The ruins of King Deshret’s civilization and Khaj-Nisut is once more opened when the Traveler accepted a commission from a scholar who wanted to complete his thesis

  - The Traveler obtained a stone slate from the scholar that allowed them to open the doors of the ruins

  - The Traveler befriended Jeht, who then took in a machine as a companion, naming it Benben

  - An Eremite named Samail gained King Deshret’s authority when he sat on the throne, almost killing everyone had Jeht’s father, Jebrael, not sacrificed himself

  - Jeht returned to the Tanit tribe, a tribe her father hailed from, after losing him

**DESERT OF HADRAMAVETH** [(return to top)](#id.d99ut0di65pp)

- There is a third ruin golem in Hadramaveth, it was fully operational until the circuits are eventually fried

- Under King Deshret’s grace, a shepherd named Ormazd Shah raised a city named Gurabad after defeating Huvashtra the Tyrant and uniting the desert folks. He then married a Jinni named Liloupar who believed he’s able to realize the Flower Goddess’s dream of a slavery-free society

  - They went to have 300 children, one of them was Shirin, whose child Liloupar prophesied will bring down the city

  - Ormazd adopted Kisra Parvez _(a/n: Kisra is Liloupar’s blood son btw\..)_ and made him his champion, and married him to Shirin

  - Coveting the power of King Deshret, Ormazd set his eyes on Tulaytullah and burnt it to the ground, ordering the Sages to surrender him the Temple of Silence

  - Liloupar saw how Ormazd grew drunk with power and cursed him for three generations

  - Ormazd and his 299 children then died at the hands of Kisra and Shirin after Shirin grew hateful of her boring marriage

  - Kisra calls himself Parvezravan and took the throne, an heir was then born; Shiruyeh. He banished Shiruyeh out of the city once he’s grown, fearing Liloupar’s prophecy

  - Shirin searched for Shiruyeh and convinced him to kill Kisra before taking the throne, but Shiruyeh was wracked with guilt and fell into the Abyss not long after

  - King Deshret punished Liloupar for her misdeeds and split her soul into seven, with her most dominant soul fragment kept in her cell

  - Gurabad was swallowed by the sands when a plague descended on the city shortly after, Shirin’s fate remained unknown

- 500 years ago at Wadi al-Majuj, hoard of monsters poured out, causing the downfall of Gurabad

  - These monsters are said to have branched out from the Tunigi Hollows rift

- Present day, the Traveler managed to free Liloupar and became her master when the Tanit tribe required her assistance in finding the Eternal Oasis

  - Matriarch Babel wanted to restore fertility to the tribe’s soil by finding the Oasis

  - Liloupar refused to aid them but assisted the Traveler in finding the Oasis regardless. She eventually realized that King Deshret’s promise of the Goddess’s return is a lie

  - The mechanism keeping the Eternal Oasis in stasis was disrupted, and it will eventually be buried in the sands as well

  - Jeht laid her father’s weapon and her mother’s notebook in the Oasis, fulfilling their wish

- The ruins of Gurabad are revealed afterwards, and Liloupar returned to the sands after gathering her soul fragments

- The Tanit tribe were then eradicated when Matriarch Babel actually  wanted to end the Traveler to take control of Liloupar and the Eternal Oasis

  - She wanted to bring back the Flower Goddess, believing that she’s still in the Oasis and to rule the desert

  - Jeht and the Traveler worked together to end them, causing Jeht to travel the desert with Benben when the ordeal is done

**GIRDLE OF THE SANDS** [(return to top)](#id.d99ut0di65pp)

- An area that was hit the worst during the Cataclysm

- The people of Khaenri’ah built a facility deep beneath Temir Mountains where their gate is still presently standing, albeit now sealed

  - This facility also connected them to realms beyond which eventually brought forth the surge of monsters that caused the Cataclysm

- After retreating to the rainforest, Rukkhadevata created Simurgh, a divine bird, from energy (Khvarena) given to her by the Goddess of Flowers

  - The Flower Goddess had prophesied about the Cataclysm to Rukkhadevata

  - Rukkhadevata charged Simurgh to guard the border between new birth and death

  - Simurgh lived amongst the pines, cypresses, and snow-lotuses, and slumbered in dreams. She awakened when the Cataclysm hits

- When Egeria of Fontaine was slain in the upheaval, her body transformed into the waters of Amrita

- Simurgh drank the primordial Amrita waters before sacrificing herself to cleanse the land

  - She split herself into infinite motes of Khvarena

  - Khvarena that fell on the Amrita created a sea of flowers known as Vourukasha Oasis where the Pari made their home

  - Sentient Khvarena then became beings called Pari, and the first is named Zurvan, who gathered other Khvarena motes to fight monsters following Simurgh’s will

- Sign of Apaosha, a mirror to the Abyss, appeared in the sky together with a rift at Tunigi Hollow that brought forth the monsters of the Cataclysm

  - The rift brought forth dark fires that defile the land

  - Nasejuna claims that Khaenri’ahns call it the Sign of Truth, as it reflects the reality beyond the skies

- A Darshan of the Akademiya, known as Samaniyyah or Order of the Skeptics, appeared in the area to make a stand against the darkness together with Khaenri’ahns and the Pari

  - Countless humans, Khaenri’ahns, and Pari sacrificed themselves in the battle

  - A man named Nagarjuna made a connection with Zurvan and helped seal the Sign of Apaosha, gaining divine power. His followers are called Nagarjunites

  - They branched further from the Akademiya and created their own academic traditions, they worship the Khvarena

  - They remained in the desert and are considered a lost Darshan by the Akademiya

- An unknown God of the Pari used all her powers to hold back the Sign of Apaosha, tainting herself in the process and unable to be reborn on a purer plane

  - Her consciousness roamed the mortal realm until Rukkhadevata anchored it with the Harvisptokhm that grew from the Amrita waters

  - Her consciousness slumbers within Harvisptokhm on a giant lotus called Gaokerena

- The Sign of Apaosha eventually disappeared with the existence of Harvisptokhm and Khvarena, the impurities both in the sky and on the earth can be cleaned easily

  - Giant trees grew around the rift to block it

  - Nagarjuna and Zurvan performed the Rite of Chinvat to help Harvisptokhm seal the rift permanently

- The familiar of thorns, Mihir, remained in Asipattravana Swamp to hold back purple mists that shared the same filth as the monsters

  - She became defiled by the impurity and needed to do a Cleansing Pilgrimage to purify herself in order to return to the Oasis

- Zurvan met with Dainsleif in the wilderness at one point while the monsters still roam the land, and fought alongside him for a time to defeat the darkness at the Oasis

  - According to her, half his body has been turned into a monster but he held no monstrous aura on him

  - She also said he was tightly holding on to a ring in his hand

  - He eventually left the Oasis with the Traveler’s twin later on

- Not long after, a group of scholars from the rainforest led by a one-armed Sage appeared in front of Zurvan, claiming to have fought side-by-side with Khaenri’ahns despite their tainted reputation

  - They wanted to carry the will of the Khaenri’ahns and to completely destroy the disaster, and thus followed their footsteps to the Oasis

  - Zurvan and the scholars entered a Khaenri’ahn ruin together, finding the machines that had once fought alongside them

  - The one-armed Sage used documents left by Khaenri’ahns to find a path through the darkness towards Harvisptokhm

  - Zurvan and the Sage performed the Rite of ab-Zohr to purify the Harvisptokhm using the Amrita water, causing the Flower of Sanctity to bloom from Gaokerena

  - Monsters slowly disappear, and countless new Pari was born from the purified Oasis

  - The Sage then went to the ruins underground and was never seen again

- The Skeptics who remained in the desert formed friendships with the Pari and lived in Vourukasha Oasis

  - They forge a connection (Laupa) with the Pari and occasionally perform the Rite of ab-Zohr to cleanse Harvisptokhm of the filth that it’s holding back

  - Folly grew amongst them and they’re now unable to form Laupa with the Pari

- Five drums (Korybantes) of the elements are created to strengthen the bonds between humans and Barsom’s familiar, a Pari named Rashnu

  - The Korybantes is an important catalyst for the Rite of Chinvat to strengthen the seal on Tunigi Hollow

  - Anemo and Geo drums don’t exist for some unknown reason

  - Rashnu threw the drums away one day in order to sleep, causing the Nagarjunites to panic though they don’t know it was Rashnu’s own doing

- According to Zurvan, the Skeptics shouldn’t have any records on the Rite of Chinvat despite their history together

  - She was the one who used the Khvarena to repair the seal

  - She was the one who fused the strongest Khvarena there into the five Great Songs to purify the land

  - When folly grew amongst the Skeptics, their records were set aflame after they dispersed amongst themselves

- Several hundred years ago after the Cataclysm, a team from the Akademiya arrived to explore Khaenri’ahn secrets despite the Skeptic’s warnings

  - The then-leader (Vijnanapati) of the Skeptics sent a man, who was a friend of Zurvan, to join the expedition team

  - Unknown what they encountered, the team was nowhere to be found and Zurvan’s friend embraced the darkness to become an Abyss Lector

- The Abyss then tried to invade Vourukasha Oasis to find the Songs of Khvarena, but Zurvan used them to seal the Oasis and the ruins, and sent the monsters scattering

  - The five Great Songs were scattered as well, but one was kept by Zurvan for future use

- At present, due to the lack of Rite of ab-Zhor to cleanse the Harvisptokhm, the Sign of Apaosha reappeared above it

  - Harvisptokhm absorbed far too much defilement and dealt with too much corrosion from the Sign to sustain the Khvarena

- The giant trees that blocked Tunigi Hollows has been eroded to become gray crystals, remnants of the dark fire embers from the Cataclysm

- Sorush, a Pari whose duty is to clear the defilement both in Harvisptokhm and Tunigi Hollows, obtained the Twin-horned Chaplet to become a Bloomguard and control the Great Songs

  - Bloomguards are proven worthy successors to Simurgh’s aspirations

  - The Chaplet is held by Zurvan until Sorush is worthy enough to have it

- The current Vijnanapati, Nasejuna, wanted the five Great Songs to reverse the Rite of Chinvat and reopen the seal to the Abyss, bringing the Cataclysm to a start once more

  - He was shown to work together with an Abyss Lector who was once Zurvan’s friend

  - He fled the area when the Traveler defeated them, unknown where he is now

- The Traveler, Sorush, Mihir, and the now-awakened Rashnu performed the Rite of Chinvat to release the seal that’s been holding back the accumulated filth within Tunigi Hollow

  - The gray crystals revitalized and became great trees once more now that the Great Songs are used to nourish them

- The Traveler and Sorush then cleared Harvisptokhm of its impurities using the Rite of ab-Zohr, causing the Flower of Sanctity to bloom once more and spreading Amrita waters all over the land, revitalizing the Oasis

  - They retrieved Spenta Hearts from within the impurities and reawakened the God’s consciousness within Gaokerena

  - The Pari can now relax within the Oasis

**FONTAINE** [(return to top)](#id.d99ut0di65pp)

- The waters in Fontaine are said to be purer than the rest of Teyvat, and anyone who has a Vision will have no trouble diving and swimming in it

- Has one of the most complex legal system in all of Teyvat

- All waters of Fontaine converge together at the Fountain of Lucine

- In the first era before the Hydro Archon’s existence, the humans were self-supporting in their virtues and needn’t need any laws or authorities

  - The heavenly envoys walked amongst them, guiding them to peace, prosperity, and abundance

- Over time, the humans grew tired of their inscrutable eternity - desiring things never promised by the divine, and attempted to break free from their fates, enraging the heavens

  - Heaven sent gigantic waves to smash their cities

  - A hundred day of rain followed afterwards, drowning all sins and arrogation

-  When the water receded, no civilization or city managed to survive. The humans lost their knowledge and wisdom, living no different from animals

  - This era lasted throughout the rise and fall of Gurabad

- The first Oceanid was born from Egeria’s first tear. Other Oceanids are then born from it. Egeria then coveted the power of the Primordial Sea to turn them into humans

  - This was the first sin which enraged Celestia, bringing the prophecy forth

  - Egeria is imprisoned within the Primordial sea as a result, and Scylla the Dragon King was tasked to guard her

- In a ruin within Fontaine, there exists stone slates that outlined Fontaine’s prophecy

  - It was the work of a Khaenri’ahn Sinner, Vedrfolnir, who possesses the power to see a fate as large as this

- Fontaine was eventually restored to civilization when Remus descended upon his golden Fortuna, establishing Remuria _(a/n: read_ [_REMURIA_](#id.68agm09jrncq) _for more)_

  - It lasted a while before it was sunk beneath the waves

- Later on, Egeria was granted the Hydro Gnosis and was freed by Celestia, and took over as Fontaine’s Archon up till her body’s destruction at the Girdle of Sands which created the Amrita waters 500 years ago

  - She sent Oceanids across Teyvat as spies, though not for malicious intent, merely wanting to connect everyone like how water is connected

  - Exiled convicts who were sent to the seaside received her sympathy, creating the Fortress of Meropide per her decree where they keep an eye on the Primordial Sea’s seal

- After Egeria’s death, Focalor took over and was made aware of the prophecy

  - This prompted her to enact her plan in deceiving the Heavenly Principles and splitting her divinity and humanity aka Furina apart _(read:_ [_HYDRO ARCHON/FOCALORS/LADY FURINA/FURINA_](#id.e9kh7yd3taze) _for more)_

  - Focalor created the Oratrice Mecanique d’Analyse Cardinale as the final verdict for every trial and to collect Idemnitium, but also hid her Gnosis and divinity there for when the prophecy arrives

  - She also invited Neuvillette, the Hydro Sovereign Dragon, to the Court of Fontaine to act as the Iudex, he eventually brought in the Melusines to live amongst humans

- Fontaine is built atop an elevated plane due to the rising seawater from the impending prophecy. The people at the Court often had to break and rebuild the structures with the water’s rising

  - As the prophecy has come to a pass, the water level remained where it is

- As the city grew, an underworld of Fontaine called Fleuve Cendre was born beneath the city where poorer people and exiles who returned from the Fortress of Meropide build a new life. It became an underground gray area where the Gardes have little access to

  - Around 500 years ago before the Cataclysm, it was ruled by an outlaw named Eduardo Baker. He was then arrested due to a disagreement with the Court of Fontaine’s bureaucracy. This caused the Gardes to raid the place to capture him in an event called the Purge of Fleuve Cendre

  - Currently, the Spina di Rosula has taken control of Fleuve Cendre

- Just outside the Court of Fontaine lies Poisson, a quiet little village whose people live a life of fishing and underwater salvage

  - It was once under siege after Eduardo’s henchmen saved him from the Marechaussee Hunters and used Poisson as hostage. It became a bloodbath when Eduardo’s men kept giving out unreasonable demands, killing the mayor of Poisson and many others

  - Eduardo’s biological son, Jakob, was sent to the Narzissenkreuz Institute along with the mayor’s son, Rene de Petrichor after the siege _(read:_ [_NARZISSENKREUZ_](#id.3abh1v9zrg79) _for more)_

  - Currently it’s the Spina di Rosula’s home base  

- During the Cataclysm, a giant beast named Elynas rampaged through Fontaine and destroyed everything, much like Durin. He was hunted by Captain Basil on the Sponsian and died on one of the islands _(read:_ [_THE TRAVELER_](#id.48yn34oktohb) _for more info on Elynas)_

  - His body hardened instead of decaying, and his consciousness remained despite his death

  - Due to his toxic blood, the waters of Fontaine became polluted, which drove the Oceanids away. Some, however, left because they refuse to serve Focalors

  - Melusines, creatures who perceive the world differently than humans, came to existence from his flesh. The initially can hear his voice, but lost the ability as time passed. Currently, only Mamere can hear him

- Alain Guillotin, a genius in machinery, eventually established the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering to find solution to the waterline crisis

  - The kamera was also built by the Research Institute

  - Presently, the Research Institute blew up when Edwin Eastinghouse was conducting some experiments, resulting in the indefinite suspension of the Callas aquabus line, but he wasn’t present during the explosion. He was eventually sent to the Fortress of Meropide when the Traveler found him

- Trials and operas are done in the Opera Epiclese, where trials are used to create Idemnitium to power Fontaine’s mekas and machineries

  - The Idemnitium was gathered by Focalors for 500 years to execute herself in order to destroy the throne of the Hydro Archon, only a fraction of the Idemnitium was used on Fontaine

- The Fortress of Meropide became an autonomous body outside the Court of Fontaine’s jurisdiction that houses their prisoners, and the people are no longer aware that the Primordial Sea is sealed beneath it

  - Wriothesley however is aware, and began constructing the Wingalet, a ship inspired by King Remus’s Fortuna to get everyone to safety when the prophecy came to be

  - The Sea managed to burst forth at one point, but was resealed by Neuvillette. It then seeped to Poisson, dissolving many people in the process including Melus and Silver, but it receded shortly after

- Presently, the authority of Hydro has been returned to Neuvillette and the throne of the Hydro Archon destroyed by Focalors during the prophecy’s happening

  - Neuvillette pardoned the sins of Fontainians just before the flood happened, and turned them all into real humans with true blood as opposed to the Primordial Sea blood they once had

  - The Oratrice is now deactivated as the Gnosis is no longer in use and given to Arlecchino, as Neuvillette has no need for it

- Neuvillette now presides over Fontaine but still remains as its Chief Justice

  - The people never saw Furina’s execution and knew nothing about what happened to Focalor or Neuvillette, they thought that the prophecy had been wrong

- Narzissenkreuz Institute was an establishment around 500-400 years ago that housed orphans and children of criminals, and is led by an Oceanid director named Lyris

- Prior to the Cataclysm, the Institute was once on land, and was home to Emanuel Guillotin, Basil Elton, Dwight Lasker, and Karl Ingold who grew up and often played games together

  - Emanuel used to play the ‘hero’ to fight against Karl, who took the role of the evil dragon Jabberwok

  - Emanuel eventually grew up to be a Marechaussee Hunter, Basil Elton became the Vice Director and Captain of the Sponsian, Dwight Lasker became the director for the Institute of Natural Philosophy, and Karl Ingold became a journalist

- After the Siege of Poisson, the Narzissenkreuz Institute became home to new children, namely Alain and Mary-Ann, Rene de Petrichor, and Jakob

  - During their time here, Rene and Alain often have play-acting together where Rene played as the evil dragon, and Alain played as the heroic knight

  - Rene, who’s a prodigy even at a young age, acknowledged Alain’s genius with machinery and believed that adults are too pedantic

- When the Cataclysm arrived, Captain Basil Elton entrusted Alain and Mary-Ann to Emanuel, while Rene and Jakob were entrusted to Karl before her death after battling Elynas

  - Alain and Mary-Ann went on to take the Guillotin surname, as did Jakob with Ingold, but Rene kept his family name as he wasn’t particularly close to Karl who had been the negotiator between Eduardo and the Courts which led to the death of his father

- Lyris, who had gone with her sisters to ‘defeat evil at its source’ never returned. This brought the disbandment of the Narzissenkreuz Institute before it was flooded in the first diluvian period that sunk most of Fontaine

- After the Cataclysm, Alain and Mary-Ann, and Jakob and Rene went their separate ways

  - Alain enrolled in the Institute of Natural Philosophy in pursuit of mechanical research, and was promptly seen as a child prodigy when he made a breakthrough with clockwork meka

  - Rene, Jakob, and Karl went to the Girdle of the Sands some time after the Cataclysm where they studied the Harvisptokhm. Rene noted that its composition is similar to his and Jakob’s, but different from Karl’s

- During their trip to the Girdle of the Sands, Jakob fell into a coma due to his weak constitution. Rene wanted to save him using the Abyssal power present there but Karl vehemently forbade him. Rene did it anyway behind Karl’s back, which caused Jakob no longer needing sustenance to live

  - Rene and Jakob also discovered the ‘world-formula’ by reverse-engineering Khaenri’ahn data which they used to predict Fontaine’s future. This is how they predicted the apocalyptic flood

  - The Abyssal power mutated Jakob’s body, allowing him to morph into the Iniquitous Baptist

  - The two did everything they can to hide Jakob’s constitution hidden from Karl

- By the time the three returned to Fontaine, Rene and Jakob formed a plan to avoid the disaster by extracting the ‘will’ of an unknown identity and to investigate the ancient Golden Troupe of Remuria for new possibilities

  - They perused countless volumes from the ruins of an ancient order but couldn’t change the results of their predictions

  - Rene speculated that introducing ‘variables’ such as Abyssal power could alter the impending apocalypse

  - They later encountered ruins that the Golden Troupe left behind and found the Seal of Chymical Marriage

- Rene and Jakob became interested in Elynas’s remains where they sensed the presence of a ‘will’ which was Elynas’s consciousness becoming aware of their presence

  - Rene hesitated wanting to strengthen Jakob using Elynas’s poisonous flesh, but Jakob went and consumed it on his own with only minor reactions. This encouraged them to do more testing

- The four eventually met again within Elynas when they were conducting their personal research, and Alain eventually recommended Rene and Jakob to Dwight to join the Institute of Natural Philosophy

  - Dwight eventually accepted Rene and Jakob into the Institute, not knowing that Rene had done body modifications to Jakob

- In the Institute, Rene and Jakob were both assigned to temporarily work in Alain’s lab

  - They were tasked to help Alain research on Khaenri’ahn war machines and Primal Constructs

  - This is where they met with Alain’s assistant; Carter Scherbius who has an illness that left him bedridden for days

- Rene eventually found that the intelligence of the Institute’s researchers -aside from Alain- to be worse than expected

  - However, he recognized that their influence on Fontaine’s society was needed to spread awareness of the apocalyptic predictions he and Jakob had found

  - He and Jakob planned on using the Book of Revealing to show others the vision they had seen

- Carter and Mary-Ann suggested a picnic at Petrichor under the guise of field research. Rene discovered remnants related to the Golden Troupe including Remuria’s golems and damaged maps there

  - This suggests that Remuria is somewhere near that area

- When Carter relapsed, Rene and Jakob found out about his illness and tried to find a cure for him. They were also frustrated with Alain who refused to trust anyone’s research beside his own

  - They separated from Alain and went to Dwight, proposing an independent research related to the Abyss which included studying Durin’s blood, Elynas’s remains, and Dark Mud from the Chasm which was approved by Dwight

- After their research separation, Alain successfully created the Arkhe system that brought forth Pneumousia energy. While Jakob’s and Rene’s lab were sealed off from the others due to the dangerous substances they’re researching

  - Shortly after Alain’s Arkhe system was created, Rene and Jakob obtained a red gemstone from Dragonspine which they dub as Scarlet Quartz

  - Jakob verified that the Quartz has similar properties to Elynas’s flesh and the Dark Mud

- Eventually, Rene and Jakob’s research stalled, but Rene managed to use Jakob to persuade the adults of the Institute to join them in a secret society called Narzissenkreuz Ordo

- Unknown when, but Alain and Mary-Ann both joined the Marechaussee Hunter while Rene was secretly expanding the Ordo

  - He also knew that Rene and Jakob were conducting secret experiments using Elynas’s remains to cure Carter

- When Carter’s condition continues to worsen even after Rene sent his cell samples to Sumeru, Jakob suggested Rene use the same method he did at the Girdle of the Sands by harnessing the power of the Abyss

  - Jakob and Rene were candid with Carter about their intentions, but Carter eventually became a willing participant

- Rene and Jakob’s experiment on Carter failed, causing his body to deteriorate and forcing the two to stop further tissue collapse. He’s eventually preserved in a somewhat-conscious state

  - Alain found out what happened to Carter and broke all ties with Jakob and Rene

  - Carter, despite being mutilated, was still vocal. Rene tried cutting his vocal chords but it regrew within days

- After the fallout, Rene and Jakob focused on expanding the Ordo and basically turning it into a cult to figure out and stop the apocalypse

  - They, along with the Ordo members, returned to Petrichor where they then found the origins of all Fontainian - humanoid Oceanids created by Egeria from the Primordial Sea

  - They also found that ancient Remurians managed to preserve their consciousness in stone golems to withstand the apocalypse

  - The Seal of Chymical Marriage was discovered to be a spell used by Remurians to seal the Primordial Sea

- Rene eventually discovered that the Primordial Sea will erupt from a suppressed breach known as the Fortress of Meropide according to the Seal of Chymical Marriage

  - He planned that after all Fontainians have been dissolved, he will receive all the consciousness at the center of the Circle of Four Orthants to save them from the All-Devouring Narwhal that was mentioned in the ‘world-formula’

- Alain created Seymour, a meka dog to act as a steward for Mary-Ann following Carter’s previous suggestion of a thinking kamera

- As time passes, the Narzissenkreuz Ordo constructed the tower of Ipsissimus as a stronghold so that Rene can move forward with his plan to merge Fontainians’ consciousness together into the tower

  - The tower came from an old concept from Remuria that was used to describe a will that can rule, sustain, and destroy the world

  - Lyris, who had somehow returned from her battle during the Cataclysm, was invited to join the Ordo by Rene and Jakob, though she was reluctant at first. Rene needed her pure water ability to extract and merge wills for his plan

- Using Lyris’s purified essence, Rene became the first subject of his radical experiment and had his personality removed. He believes that his success will save Carter and regained the Guillotin siblings’ trust

  - His plan failed, and he was almost completely dissolved until Jakob saved him through some unknown methods

- Jakob then took over and told the other Ordo members that Rene was performing a ‘Great Ritual’ within the tower and was not to be disturbed, all while trying to figure out how to save Rene’s disembodied existence while the tower is still being built

  - He managed to re-extract Rene’s persona and placed them in the Four Orthants that the Ordo built, he also discovered the research of alchemist Rhinedottir and the Hexenzirkel

  - He also dissolved members of the Ordo who grew suspicious of Rene’s condition, hiding their disappearances as ‘leaving the Ordo’

- Eventually, Jakob managed to plant Rene’s existence within Hydro Eidolons born from the dissolved Ordo members, calling it Narzissenkreuz who then returned to the Ordo’s leadership

  - Jakob implanted Rene’s persona, but left out his previous failures; saving Carter and his dissolving, so that Rene can transcend

  - Narzissenkreuz then created Caterpillar through the remnants of ‘them’, likely Carter’s remains and the dissolved Ordo by grafting them onto Hilichurls before placing him at the Fortress of Meropide

- Dwight received an investigation report of abnormal activities within the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, and sent Emanuel to investigate

  - Narzissenkreuz proceeded to dissolves Emanuel and Marfisa the Champion Duelist when she tried finding him, gaining their memories and skills

- The Court of Fontaine deemed the Ordo a threat, and sent the Marechaussee Hunters which includes the Guillotin siblings to detain Narzissenkreuz and the Ordo members

- Narzissenkreuz sent Jakob, Caterpillar, Lyris, and the other Ordo members to Elynas who then tried to reanimate the corpse just before they were confronted by the Marechaussee Hunters

  - This was a ploy by Narzissenkreuz to attract the Hunters’ attention away from him

  - Alain went to the tower to confront Narzissenkreuz, who then fell into the Primordial Sea during their confrontation

- The battle at Elynas eventually led to heavy casualties when an explosion was set off within the body of the beast, defeating all the Ordo members and severely damaging Seymour

  - Mary-Ann was fatally injured, dissolved, and absorbed by Lyris

  - Jakob remained alive to the present day

- Alain later on left the Marechaussee Hunters to establish the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering, naming the Suppression Specialist Mek to commemorate Carter

  - He later retired from the Research Institute in his old age and isolated himself in his workshop before his death

- Presently, Jakob remained hidden and traveled around Fontaine to reverse the Seal of Chymical Marriage in preparation of Narzissenkreuz’s revival. This caused numerous Rifthounds and Local Legends to emerge where the seal was reversed

  - He also posed as a painting collector to get Mamere’s painting that was made using Elynas’s blood to revive him

  - He wanted to release the seal of the Primordial Sea to create a new world with Narzissenkreuz

- Cater, Seymour, Ann, and the Traveler eventually managed to stop him at the Tower of Ipsissimus where the tower’s Doomsday Clock hand fell and presumably killing him

  - They managed to free Ann who was born from the merging of Lyris and Mary-Ann, where Lyris wanted nothing more than to return to the Narzissenkreuz Institute and relive the old days where they play make-believe

  - They also managed to defeat Narzissenkreuz Rene within the Primordial Sea before setting his existence free from his Eidolon body

- Cater, Seymour, Ann, Mamere, and the mimic Mary-Ann then went on an adventure together

**REMURIA** [(return to top)](#id.d99ut0di65pp)

- According to Ruggiero’s notes in Bravais’ study, Petrichor is named ‘golem’ in ancient language and is in the vicinity of many ruins and stone statues related to Remuria’s Golden Troupe

  - Ruggiero say that Petrichor has a mysterious energy lingering there, pulling him towards it

  - He also mentioned a Faded Castle of legend there

- Ancient Remurians used music to record everything, including magic, but their thinking was so peculiar that it hardly seem human

- After the destruction of the first era, Remus, a God who refuses to follow King Deshret, went to move to Fontaine before visiting the Primordial Sea and meeting with the imprisoned Egeria who gave him a goblet of Primordial Water

  - He used the goblet to refine Primordial Water to create artificial Ichor to hold wisdom and memories

  - She warned him of Fontaine’s prophesied flood

- Remus then found the seer Sybilla -a survivor of the previous era- beneath the world at a silver tree, who took the form of a Golden Bee, before going on to his ship the Fortuna and establishing Remuria

  - On top of Fontaine’s prophecy, the Seers later on prophesied discord, that Remuria will eventually fall, causing Remus to search for a means to retain its eternity

  - To allow his subjects to retain eternal lives, Remus used the artificial Ichor he had made to allow them to discard their physical bodies and planting their souls into undying golems

- Remus raided and conquered the surrounding settlements with his undying army, even making the Vishaps surrender to his power. Under him are four Harmosts who act as his governors in ruling the city, with whom he shared his Godly powers with

  - Remuria is eventually called the Eternal City where Remus used music as a means to ensure his prosperity, constantly listening and cutting any discord within the harmony

  - His favored Harmost is called Boethius, who was taken in when Remus’s army invaded his tribe. He was a musician who befriended a servant named Cassiodor, whose tribe was also invaded and destroyed

  - He taught his people how to farm and raise crops, built temples and cities with giant rocks, and spread the beauty of music and art

- To defy the prophesied destruction, Remus composed a harmonious symphony of prosperity, believing that as long as it echoes through the land, they would escape fate’s aka Fortuna’s judgment

  - He personally corrects any discord within the music, ensuring perfection within the harmony

- The harmonious melody is then named Phobos, and through it, all Remurians live their lives according to the symphony that has been given to them

  - It’s mentioned that their lives are nothing more like puppets following a Maestro

  - Unbeknownst to everyone, Phobos -who was once Sybilla’s wisdom- gained sentience thanks to Remus’s powers, and was leading the Remurians according to their hearts’ desire instead of going against fate per Sybilla’s wish; to make humans happy by granting their wishes

- Remuria grew in power and size as time went on. Remus retreated to the capital -Capitolium- to fall into slumber, while his Harmosts take care of the city and fighting barbarians

  - Some of Remuria’s landmarks are the Ocean Pillars where ships dock, tower of Remuria to guide ships traveling between islands, Machimos where the warriors live, and Capitolium which is said to be the paradise for musicians and artists

- Though Remuria was at its height of prosperity, it still had its enemies after Remus ordered that all Oceanids and Vishaps are killed so that all Primordial Water can be turned to Ichor

  - The Vishap King, Scylla, and the Lochknights of the Oceanids who worshipped Egeria called Remus a tyrant and constantly opposed him. Boethius and his Golden Troupe is usually the one who goes out to fight them

  - At an unknown point in time, Cassiodor established the Marechaussee Hunter, and was called the ‘Golden Hunter’ much to his embarrassment

- Over time, the Harmosts grew drunk with the divine power granted by Remus causing corruption and decadence to run rampant within the city

  - The people of Remuria who had their physical bodies ripped from their souls via Remus’s artificial Ichor could no longer endure the separation agony, creating chaos in its wake

  - It’s said that Heaven judged Remus guilty in sharing his Godly powers with humans and to attempt to defy fate

- When Scylla banded together with a group of barbarians and other Vishaps to lead a massive charge against Remuria, Boethius decided to purge them all

  - Cassiodor, who had tried to control Boethius’s rampage and telling him not everyone enjoyed Remus’s ways of expanding Remuria, was disappointed before going his separate way

- Scylla’s plan to attack the Capitolium had been orchestrated by Remus himself when he realized how corrupted Remuria had gotten

  - His plan was to have Scylla invade the Capitolium, while Remus instructs the Phobos to self-destruct and sacrifice himself in order to return the will of his people

  - Remus had personally separated Cassiodor from Phobos before the attack, leaving him to be the only one with a free will 

- When Remus wanted his people to fall back from Scylla’s ‘attack’, Boethius, seeing it as a betrayal, stole the goblet of Ichor, sealed Scylla at the Initium Iani before closing the gates, and sunk together with the city in an Abyssal storm after Remus’s sacrifice

  - He then spent the next few thousand years harmonizing with the music of Phobos to bring Remuria back to its former glory

  - The souls of the Remurians remain trapped beneath the sea as a result

  - Despite the destruction, the Capitolium remains in one piece due to Remus’s will

- The storm is said to have been so swift and sudden that the knowledge of what had happened is now hidden together with Remuria

  - Scholars agreed that Remuria had forsaken their noble duties by embracing hedonism and debauchery, accepting violence they inflicted on others, and was thus violently destroyed

- Later, the Hydro Archon Egeria settled the conflicts between the few remaining human tribes and established Fontaine as a whole

- The small town of Petrichor is what remained of the sunken Remuria, as statues of the ancient city lie scattered around it together with the -now sealed- entrance

- At present, due to Boethius’s influence, the people of Petrichor had their souls stolen and replaced by those trapped in Remuria, leaving them in a dream-like state until the Traveler and Cassiodor played the Requiem to utterly destroy Phobos and release the Remurians’ souls

  - Cassiodor ended up as a spirit-keeper for Remuria during its destruction, and led the Traveler into the city when Petrichor was under Phobos’s influence before his soul was released along with his fellow Remurians

  - Scylla, whose body has now turned to Ichor, was released thanks to Cassiodor and the Traveler, allowing him to break through the Initium Iani’s gates to the Capitolium and swim freely once more

  - Phobos, who had sensed that Remus wanted to destroy it all those years ago, absorbed Boethius’s will completely and used its symphony on his empty body to sink the city and engineer Remuria’s return, all so it can continue granting people’s happiness

  - One of the Archon is named Cochanina who cleverly kicked a dragon out of the People of the Springs’ land

  - The strongest from each tribe will be chosen to go against the Abyss in the Night Warden War at the end of the competition

  - Only those from Natlan can contest in the Pilgrimage, all to create the Contending Fire to feed to the Sacred Flame and keeping it alight

    - Also because only those who bear an Ancient Name can be revived

    - The Sacred Flame keeps the Abyss at bay and provide each Archon with significant knowledge and memory of the land

- During the Cataclysm, Natlan is the worst-hit nation due to their weak and unstable ley lines. And the Abyss is merely driven underground as opposed to completely be purged

  - Tenoch, an exile, rounded people from each tribe to fight against the Abyss including an ancestor of Huitzli named Burkina and his Saurian companion, Kongamoto the Mountain King, and the giant Tupac

    - He later fell in battle and was unable to be resurrected due to him giving up his Ancient Name

    - Kongamoto ended up corrupted by the Abyss and killed Burkina in its madness

  - The Night Kingdom was corrupted, and the light of the Wayob’s totems, proxies in which they extend their consciousness in the Kingdom, dimmed

    - The heroes calculated that they have 500 years before the Night Kingdom is lost to the Abyss

  - Mavuika, the Pyro Archon then, offered her life within the Sacred Flame to ‘die’ before her time in order to be reawakened 500 years later to fight against the Abyss once more

    - Her plan is to have the six tribes reunited and fight with the bearer of Ancient Names who fought in the Cataclysm

- The corrosion from the Cataclysm resulted in a massive Pyro energy shortage. Natlan is currently at a breaking point

- Kongamoto, who is still alive, needs to be regularly cleansed of Abyssal filth. This is done by the Scions of the Canopy in a ceremony called Turnfire Night.

  - Only half of the filth is to be cleansed in order to keep him alive and asleep, just so the Chief can keep their legacy and history alive

    - Kongamoto’s mind and soul has been completely eaten by the corrosion, and it’s only moving because of the Abyssal power contained in him

- After reawakening, Mavuika suspended the Pilgrimage when the heroes of 500 years ago didn’t get passed down as she had hoped

  - The Ancient Names of 500 years ago were passed down and the knowledge of the Cataclysm should be delivered, but that isn’t the case

    - This is due to the corrosion in the Night Kingdom

- Currently, the Pilgrimage and Night Warden War are over for the foreseeable future

- The Abyss has been pushed back after all 6 heroes were awakened, but not completely eradicated. Mavuika plans on fighting it alone

  - The affairs of the Alberich clan is not to be recorded for some reason, but Kaeya managed to save a letter of their history that his 'father' almost burned

- When the King’s state became indisposed and the kingdom faced unknown threats, Knight Marshal Anfortas proclaimed that he will take temporary post as Regent and led the Regnum Concilium Ultimum (Kingdom of the Last Council) until normalcy return

- Established a facility under Temir Mountains in Sumeru where they created a furnace to make Azosite, energy blocks that was extracted from the elements

  - The Azosite is said to fare poorly compared to a newly-discovered ‘perpetual’ energy source

  - The engineers in charge of the facility found that Azosite has efficiency problems, and that using power cores on Field Tillers are much more convenient

- Had a Royal Library that contained banned books with information on The Seven

  - Chlothar read a banned book that has information on medicine that relieves mania but needs the blessing of the Dendro Archon to work

- Pure-blooded Khaenri’ahn have diamond-shaped pupils in their eyes

  - Such as Kaeya, Dainsleif, Pierro, Halfdan, and Chlothar Alberich. Kaeya's diamond eyes are slightly different however

  - They are cursed with immortality after the Cataclysm, others were turned to monsters such as Chlothar’s son; Caribert. There is no reversal to the curse

- The people knew of the Traveler’s twin, and looked to them to bring new hope and strength to Khaenri’ah only to have the Cataclysm happen instead

  - To them, the Traveler’s twin is the Abyss, a wondrous mystery far beyond their imagination and comprehension

  - Chlothar Alberich was the one to call the Traveler’s twin as Prince/Princess of Khaenri’ah

- There are five extraordinary people with great esteem who divided a great power that can destroy the world amongst themselves, and did nothing during the Cataclysm. They are now called the Sinners, and have become transcendent beings

  - "The Wise" Hroptatyr, "The Visionary" Vedrfolnir, "Gold" Rhinedottir, "The Foul" Surtalogi, and "Rächer of Solnari" Rerir

  - Vedrfolnir is Dainsleif’s brother, Surtalogi is Skirk’s Master, and Rhinedottir is Albedo’s Master and creator

- After failing to stop the catastrophe, Dainsleif wandered the lands since with a mysterious ring on his person

  - He instructed Halfdan to keep the people of Khaenri'ah safe, an order Halfdan followed for 500 years up to his demise

  - Half of his body has been turned into a monster, but he has no monstrous aura on him

  - He traveled with the Traveler’s twin ‘in search of their fate’, but they didn’t reach the journey’s end together

- It's hinted that Pierro was unable to stop the rulers of Khaenri’ah from ‘tearing away the veil of sin’, causing the Cataclysm

- Il Capitano escaped with a few of his people when the situation grew dire and sought refuge in Natlan

- The Schwanenritter were in charge of evacuating the citizens to above ground, though some stayed as they can’t go any further

- The Cataclysm made the pure-bloods resent The Seven even more than before, and believed begging for their blessing a humiliation

  - Some joined the Abyss Order to overthrow the Heavens

- Rostam's disciple, the Bloodstained Knight, saw an injustice within the ruins of Khaenri'ah after his death, and this made him join the Abyss Order

- Kaeya was sent by his father to Dawn Winery as an agent of ‘an ancient plot’, citing him as the last hope for Khaenri'ah _(a/n: The Chinese translation says he is a pawn rather than an agent)_

  - His right eye was injured from his battle with Diluc but not blinded, yet he had been wearing the eyepatch prior to the injury

  - Kaeya however believed that his father wanted him to have a normal life

- Gold was a famed alchemist with a multitude of creatures she created

  - Rifthound wolves that were accidental creations out of chalk and alfisol

  - Durin, created out of hummus who she then abandoned

  - A one-horned white horse

  - Elynas, yet to be fully confirmed but it’s kind of obvious at this point

- Gold also created a progenitor to Albedo called Subject Two, but it was swallowed by Durin

  - After Durin fell and died, Subject Two observed its surrounding and saw Subject One making friends, triggering its desire to be a perfect human

- After the fall of Khaenri'ah, Gold created Albedo, her most perfect and successful Primordial Human Project

  - She dubbed him Subject One, a creation out of chalk

  - The diamond mark on his neck acted as his 'bellybutton' during his creation, where alchemy flowed inwards. He calls it the mark of his only imperfection

- Gold found a 'Heart of Naberius' together with Albedo deep within a cavern. She then disappeared and left Albedo in Alice's care

  - She left Albedo a recommendation letter to be taken to the Knights of Favonius

  - She gave her final assignment to him; to find the truth of the world

- Its age is estimated to be at minimum 4000 years as Guizhong had been collecting the ruin machines for studies, well over 3700 years ago before Liyue Harbor was established
